    "description": "“I’ve still got a real bad feeling,” mumbled Heinbichler. “And I’ll tell you all one thing: This Grimm girl can read the forest like none of us.” Forestry Student Anja Grimm is working on a soil-mapping project in a remote region in Bavaria where her father disappeared when she was just eight years old. A few days into the work, the nightmare of her childhood seems to repeat itself. Deep in the woods she runs into mentally disturbed Xaver with whom she often played when she was a child. Just hours after they meet, he hangs himself. And Xaver’s suicide will not remain the only disturbing event connected to Anja’s reappearance. An emotionally charged thriller about guilt and denial. “The Silent Forest” is set in a present day idyllic German region still haunted by terrible events that transpired there during the last days of the war – a moving story about a young woman who cannot help but read the mute testimony of the horrors of history written in the silent language of nature.",

It became one of the first encounters with people living in a place now called Hollow Earth. A hundred years later, another visitor had a less than friendly encounter. The three races of Hollow Earth had lived in peace for many centuries after a great war. But their world became threatened by a series of underground nuclear explosions that came from the surface. The people on the surface were totally ignorant of their existence and continued their explosions. Despite the Hollow Earth people being very cautious about retaliation, their patience had finally run out by the 2020s. The latest visitor became a pawn in a potential war that threatened every living thing on the surface. The Hollow Earths advanced technology meant that the surface dwellers were going to be in the fight of their lives, and they had no idea why.",

    "title": "Little Women",
    "description": "Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888), which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. Alcott wrote the books rapidly over several months at the request of her publisher. The novel follows the lives of four sisters-Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March-detailing their passage from childhood to womanhood, and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters.Little Women was an immediate commercial and critical success, and readers demanded to know more about the characters. Alcott quickly completed a second volume, entitled Good Wives. It was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 in a single work entitled Little Women. Alcott also wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo\u0027s Boys (1886). Although Little Women was a novel for girls, it differed notably from the current writings for children, especially girls. The novel addressed three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine\u0027s individual identity.\"Little Women \"has been read as a romance or as a quest, or both. It has been read as a family drama that validates virtue over wealth\", but also \"as a means of escaping that life by women who knew its gender constraints only too well\". According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children\u0027s fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format. Elbert argued that within Little Women can be found the first vision of the \"All-American girl\" and that her multiple aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.",

Soon afterwards, disturbing incidents unfold in England: a ship runs aground on the shores of Whitby, its crew vanished; beautiful Lucy Westenra slowly succumbs to a mysterious, wasting illness, her blood drained away; and the lunatic Renfield raves about the imminent arrival of his \u0027master\u0027. In the ensuing battle of wills between the sinister Count and a determined group of adversaries - led by the intrepid vampire hunter Abraham van Helsing - Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing into questions of identity, sanity and the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire. For this completely updated edition, Maurice Hindle has revised his introduction, list of further reading and notes, and added two appendices: Stoker\u0027s essay on censorship and his interview with Winston Churchill, both published in 1908. Christopher Frayling\u0027s preface discusses the significance and the influences that contributed to his creation of the Dracula myth.

She\u0027s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up--she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily\u0027s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.

Lily can\u0027t get him out of her head. But Ryle\u0027s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens. Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

    "title": "CIRCE",
    "description": "\"A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess\u0027s story,\" this #1 New York Times bestseller is \"both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right\" (Alexandra Alter, The New York Times). In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man\u0027s world. #1 New York Times bestseller -- named one of the best books of the year by NPR, the Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. “Heartbreaking, yet beautiful” (Jamie Blynn, Us Weekly), The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is “Tinseltown drama at its finest” (Redbook): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it costs—to face the truth.",
